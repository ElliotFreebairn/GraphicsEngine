# Low-Level Game Engine

A minimal game engine built from scratch using OpenGL on Debian Linux.  
Inspired by [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/)

## Goals

- Build a working 3D game engine using OpenGL
- Learn low-level graphics programming and engine architecture
- Apply some maths learn from uni and learn more complex topics
- Goal is to create a simple game using this engine

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** C+
- **Graphics:** OpenGL
- **OS:** Debian Linux
- **Learning Resource:** [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/)

## Status

Currently in early development. Building the basics:
- Window/context creation
- Input handling
- Basic rendering
- Entity/component system (WIP)
- Shaders

## Setup (will be updated when the project is functional)
